# Scavenger of Pharloom

The successor to my Geo Pots mod in Hollow Knight.
This mod has 3 features, all of which can be toggled from the Bepinex menu (F1):

- Crates, statues, and the remains of Skullbugs have a chance of dropping shell shards.
- Pots and other containers in the Citadel have a chance of dropping rosaries.
- Lamps and Cogwork constructs all release Silk Flies, and therefore have a chance to restore Silk.
